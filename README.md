this is my first project for the Odin Project Foundation course. It's unfortunate that i have  lost my entire GitHub account after completing the course, but i'm  so happy to start over and complete it again. While it is  frustrating to repeat the entire course once more but i'm relived that it will definetly gonna help me in sharpening my foundational skills.
