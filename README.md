# odin-recipes
This is my first project with The Odin Project foundation. I have successfully completed all of The Odin Project once and did have a lot of preojects that i have build, but unfortunately, I lost all of my projects that were hosted on GitHub due to accidentally losing my GitHub account. While I feel sad about the loss, I am still happy because I believe that the knowledge and skills I gained during this journey will definitely help me achieve a greater understanding of the foundation, and it will pay off in the long run.

# Project Overview
The Recipes Index Page project aims to create a user-friendly web page that serves as an index for various recipes. Users can browse through different recipes and access detailed information for each recipe.

# Technologies Used
To create this project, I utilized the following technologies and tools:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
CSS: Applied styling and layout to enhance the visual appeal.
Getting Started
To access and explore the Recipes Index Page, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. From there, you can navigate through the listed recipes and click on any recipe to access its detailed information.

# Reflection
Although I have lost my projects hosted on GitHub, I choose to focus on the positive aspect of this situation. The knowledge and understanding I gained from completing The Odin Project will continue to benefit me. While I may not have the projects to showcase, I still have the foundation that I can build upon. I am determined to continue my learning journey and apply my skills to future projects.

# Future Plans
In the future, I plan to recreate the projects I lost and further enhance my understanding of web development. I will also explore additional resources and continue expanding my knowledge to become a more proficient developer.
